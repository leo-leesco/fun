### Ad hoc polymorphism and overloading

In this lecture, you we will give an overview of static and dynamic
overloading, focus on its most common form, Haskell type classes, and also
give an introduction to Modular implicits---an extension of the module
system of OCaml with path-dependent function types and synthesis of module
applications from their signatures, which can emulate type classes.

From a meta-theoretical point of view, dynamic overloading is an
illustration of a language with a type-passing semantics, given by
elaboration, which raises the key technical issue of coherence.
